We generate a holistic model to simulate the contribution of e-flows to sustainable agriculture, food security and livelihoods. Spatially, we do this for only a small portion of the basin as a test-case. We apply holistic modeling approaches to generate conceptual impact pathways and quantitative models to forecast decision outcomes [see @do_decision_2020; @lanzanova_improving_2019; @whitney_probabilistic_2018]. This includes collaborative model development [@whitney_decision_2018-1] to assess farming futures given e-flow forecasts under different management options. To build these simulations we use functions from the `decisionSupport` [@R-decisionSupport], `dplyr` [@R-dplyr], `nasapower` [@R-nasapower], `patchwork` [@R-patchwork], `tidyverse` [@R-tidyverse] and `Evapotranspiration` libraries in the R programming language [@R-base].

```{r load_basics, include = F}
#set global options for knitr chunks 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>", 
  dpi=300, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  error = FALSE, 
  message = FALSE
)

```

The set.seed() function in R is used to create reproducible results when writing code that involves creating variables that take on random values. By using the set. seed() function, we guarantee that the same random values are produced each time we run the code

```{r set_seed_load_libraries}


# setting seed at 81 for the GLET-B81J-LRANC gauge at our e-flow site
set.seed(81)

## The model

Decision-makers often wish to have a quantitative basis for their decisions. However,‘hard data’ is often missing or unattainable for many important variables, which can paralyze the decision-making processes or lead decision-makers to conclude that large research efforts are needed before a decision can be made. That is, many variables that decision makers must consider cannot be precisely quantified, at least not without unreasonable effort. The major objective of (prescriptive) decision analysis is to support decision-making processes where decision makers are faced with this problem. Following the principles of Decision Analysis can allow us to make forecasts of decision outcomes without precise numbers, as long as probability distributions describing the possible values for all variables can be estimated. 

The `decisionSupport` package implements this as a Monte Carlo simulation, which generates a large number of plausible system outcomes, based on random numbers for each input variable that are drawn from user-specified probability distributions. This approach is useful for determining whether a clearly preferable course of action can be delineated based on the present state of knowledge without the need for further information. If the distribution of predicted system outcomes does not imply a clearly preferable decision option, variables identified as carrying decision-relevant uncertainty can then be targeted by decision-supporting research.

The `mcSimulation` function from the `decisionSupport` package can be applied to conduct decision analysis [@R-decisionSupport]. The function requires three inputs:

1. an `estimate` of the joint probability distribution of the input variables. These specify the names and probability distributions for all variables used in the decision model. These distributions aim to represent the full range of possible values for each component of the model. 
1. a `model_function` that predicts decision outcomes based on the variables named in a separate data table. This R function is customized by the user to address a particular decision problem to provide the decision analysis model.
1. `numberOfModelRuns`	indicating the number of times to run the model function.

These inputs are provided as arguments to the `mcSimulation` function, which conducts a Monte Carlo analysis with repeated model runs based on probability distributions for all uncertain variables. The data table and model are customized to fit the particulars of a specific decision.

### The `estimate`

To support the model building process we design an input table to store the `estimate` values. The table is stored locally as `limpopo_input_table.csv` and contains many of the basic values for the analysis. This table contains all the input variables used in the model. Their distributions are described by 90% confidence intervals, which are specified by lower (5% quantile) and upper (95% quantile) bounds, as well as the shape of the distribution. This model uses four different distributions:

1.	`const` – a constant value
1.	`norm` – a normal distribution
1.	`tnorm_0_1` – a truncated normal distribution that can only have values between 0 and 1 (useful for probabilities; note that 0 and 1, as well as numbers outside this interval are not permitted as inputs)
1.	`posnorm` – a normal distribution truncated at 0 (only positive values allowed)

For a full list of input variables with descriptions and the chosen distributions see the table at the end of this document. 

### Scenarios

The following function defines 3 scenarios:

1. UNRES – baseline, unrestricted water use with no e-flows: This is a scenario without eflows. Farmers extract water according to their irrigation needs. Extractions are only limited by the minimum water level that allows operating the pumps.
1. EFLOW – E-flow through abstraction control (without using dam releases) with restricted extraction: This is an eflow scenario, in which eflows are interpreted in a purely ecological sense. Whenever eflows aren't achieved, water extraction is curtailed. There are no measures to add water to the river in such events. We simulate this scenario with our own functions and some from the `nasapower` [@R-nasapower] and `Evapotranspiration` [@R-Evapotranspiration] packages.
1. SUPPL – E-flows achieved through abstraction control and dam releases: This is an eflow scenario, in which eflows are interpreted as encompassing the ecological as well as the smallholder irrigation requirement. In case eflows aren't naturally met, water is released from upstream dams to ensure eflows. Extraction by smallholder farmers is restricted only by the ability to operate the pumps.

### The conceptual model

![Model of the social effects of altered river flows on the sustainability of livelihoods in the Limpopo Basin ](figures/Fig_2_Collective_Model.png)

### The `model_function`

The decision model is coded as an R function which takes in the variables provided in the data table and generates a model output, such as the Net Present Value. 

In the following we use of various `decisionSupport` functions, which use the `tidyverse` libraries [@tidyverse2019] including `ggplot2` [@R-ggplot2], `plyr` [@R-plyr] and `dplyr` [@R-dplyr] among others in the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) [@R-base]. 

Here we generate a model as a function using `decisionSupport` library we use the `decisionSupport` functions `vv()` to produce time series with variation from a pre-defined mean.

```{r model}

source(file = "functions/limpopo_decision_function.R")

```

### Perform the Monte Carlo simulation with scenarios 

Using the model function, we can perform a Monte Carlo simulation with the `mcSimulation()` function from `decisionSupport`. This function generates distributions of all variables in the input table as well as the specified model outputs (see `return()` function above) by calculating random draws in our defined `limpopo_decision_function()`. We run a  visual assessment to ensure that all the variables in the input table are included in the model (erroneous variables listed there can cause issues with some of the post-hoc analyses). 

The `numberOfModelRuns` argument is an integer indicating the number of model runs for the Monte Carlo simulation. Unless the model function is very complex, 10,000 runs is a reasonable choice (for complex models, 10,000 model runs can take a while, so especially when the model is still under development, it often makes sense to use a lower number).

We first make a scenario file: 

We use NASA POWER From the POWER API with the `nasapower` package {@R-nasapower} for meteorology and surface solar energy climatology data.

```{r meteo_clim_data}
# load data from Evapotranspiration
data("constants")

# get global meteorology and surface solar energy climatology data
meteo_clim_data <- get_power(
  community = "ag",
  # Coordinates of the Letaba region
  lonlat = c(31.08, -23.7),
  pars = c("T2M_MAX", "T2M_MIN", "PRECTOTCORR"),
  dates = c("1981-01-01", "2020-12-31"),
  # Temporal API end-point for data being queried
  temporal_api = "daily"
)

# Test Check that the temperature and precipitation values make sense for the
# Letaba River region 
summary(meteo_clim_data$T2M_MAX) # maximum temperature is high
# but within reason (low to mid 40's have been recorded)

```

We use the Hargreaves-Samani formula in `Evapotranspiration` package {@R-Evapotranspiration} to estimate reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0). This method calculates ET0 based on daily temperature extremes (Tmax and Tmin) and extraterrestrial radiation, making it a practical and widely adopted approach for areas where detailed meteorological data are scarce. Despite its simplicity, it provides reasonable ET0 estimates under various conditions, which we validate against expected values for the Letaba River region.

```{r evapotraspiration_data}

# choose years of assessment
years <- 1981:2009

# name variables
colnames(meteo_clim_data)[c(3:5, 8, 9, 10)] <-
  c("Year", "Month", "Day", "Tmax", "Tmin", "Precipitation")

# Load raw date and climate data with Evapotranspiration
Inputs <- ReadInputs(c("Tmin", "Tmax"), meteo_clim_data, stopmissing = c(50, 50, 50))

# Implementing the Hargreaves-Samani formulation for estimating reference crop evapotranspiration
ET <-
  ET.HargreavesSamani(
    Inputs,
    constants,
    ts = "daily",
    message = "yes",
    AdditionalStats = "yes",
    save.csv = "no"
  )

# Test
# Review ET Output
summary(ET$ET.Monthly)
# monthly ET values are within expected ranges for Letaba River region

```
We use evapotranspiration data for 1980 to 2009 to build the scenarios

```{r build_scenarios}

source(file = "functions/build_scenarios.R")

# modeled scenarios
write.csv(Scenarios, file = "data/scenarios_1980_2020.csv")

```

Here we run the model with the `scenario_mc` function cf. the `decisionSupport` package [@R-decisionSupport]. The function essentially generates a Monte Carlo model with data from existing scenarios for some of the model inputs.

```{r mcSimulation_scenarios, warning=F}
source(file = "functions/limpopo_decision_function.R")
source(file = "functions/scenario_mc.R")

# run the model with the scenario_mc function 
mcSimulation_results <-
  scenario_mc(
    base_estimate = decisionSupport::estimate_read_csv("data/limpopo_input_table.csv"),
    scenarios = Scenarios, 
    # read.csv("data/scenarios_1980_2020.csv", fileEncoding ="UTF-8-BOM"),
    model_function = limpopo_decision_function,
    numberOfModelRuns = 1e2, #run 100 times (2900 with 100 simulations of 29 scenarios)
    functionSyntax = "plainNames"
  )

#save this in the data folder
write.csv(mcSimulation_results, file = "data/mcSimulation_results.csv")

```

## Sensitivity analysis

We use the `plsr.mcSimulation` function of the `decisionSupport` package to run Partial Least Squares regression on the model outputs. Projection to Latent Structures (PLS), also sometimes known as Partial Least Squares regression is a multivariate statistical technique that can deal with multiple colinear dependent and independent variables [@wold_pls-regression_2001]. It can be used as another means to assess the outcomes of a Monte Carlo model. We use the Variable Importance in the Projection (VIP) scores to identify important variables. VIP scores estimate the importance of each variable in the projection used in a PLS model. VIP is a parameter used for calculating the cumulative measure of the influence of individual variables on the model. Read more in ['A Simple Explanation of Partial Least Squares' by Kee Siong Ng](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~kee/pls.pdf). More information on all these procedures is contained in the [decisionSupport manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/decisionSupport/decisionSupport.pdf), especially under `welfareDecisionAnalysis`.  

We apply the aforementioned post-hoc analysis to the `mcSimulation()` outputs with `plsr.mcSimulation()` to determine the VIP score and coefficients of our PLS regression models. This functions use the outputs of the `mcSimulation()` selecting all the input variables from the decision analysis function in the parameter `object` and then runs a PLS regression with an outcome variable defined in the parameter `resultName`. We also need to import the input table again to replace the labels for the variables on the y-axis. The input table can include a `label` and `variable` column. The standard labels (from the `variable` column) are usually computer readable and not very nice for a plot. The `plot_pls()` function uses the text in the `label` column as replacement for the default text in the `variable` column.  


```{r pls-crop-gap}
# to ensure a clear process (not overwriting the original data) 
# rename the simulations results

## Expected Value of Perfect Information

Here we calculate the Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) using the `multi_EVPI` function in the `decisionSupport` package. The results show that there would be little additional value in the knowledge gained by gathering further knowledge on any of the variables that were included in the analysis.

```{r evpi_general}
# to ensure a clear process (not overwriting the original data) rename the
# simulations results
simulations_evpi_data <- mcSimulation_results

#here we subset the outputs from the mcSimulation function (y) by selecting the
#comparative mean crop water gap variables
simulations_evpi_data_table <- data.frame(simulations_evpi_data$x[1:71], simulations_evpi_data$y[118:119])

# Run evpi

results_evpi <- multi_EVPI(mc = simulations_evpi_data_table, 
                          first_out_var = "Mean_Crop_water_gap_difference_2_vs_1")
```

The EVPI summary statistics for the mean crop water gap difference between the baseline UNRES and EFLOW scenarios. 

```{r evpi_summary_EVPI_2vs1}
summary(results_evpi$Mean_Crop_water_gap_difference_2_vs_1)
```

The EVPI summary statistics for the mean crop water gap difference between the baseline UNRES and SUPPL scenarios.

```{r evpi_summary_SUPPL_3vs1}
summary(results_evpi$Mean_Crop_water_gap_difference_3_vs_1)
```

## Estimate values
 
```{r estimate_table, echo=F}
input_table <- read.csv("data/limpopo_input_table.csv")
kable(input_table, caption = 'This table contains the estimate values used for the Monte Carlo analysis') 
```
