We generate a holistic model to simulate the contribution of eflows to sustainable agriculture, food security and livelihoods. Spatially, we do this for only a small portion of the basin as a test-case. We apply holistic modeling approaches to generate conceptual impact pathways and quantitative models to forecast decision outcomes [see @do_decision_2020; @lanzanova_improving_2019; @whitney_probabilistic_2018]. This includes collaborative model development [@whitney_decision_2018-1] to assess farming futures given eflow forecasts under different management options. To build these simulations we use functions from the `decisionSupport` [@R-decisionSupport], `dplyr` [@R-dplyr], `nasapower` [@R-nasapower], `patchwork` [@R-patchwork], `tidyverse` [@R-tidyverse] and `Evapotranspiration` [@R-Evapotranspiration] libraries in the R programming language [@R-base].

## The model

Decision-makers often wish to have a quantitative basis for their decisions. However,‘hard data’ is often missing or unattainable for many important variables, which can paralyze the decision-making processes or lead decision-makers to conclude that large research efforts are needed before a decision can be made. That is, many variables decision makers must consider cannot be precisely quantified, at least not without unreasonable effort. The major objective of (prescriptive) decision analysis is to support decision-making processes where decision makers are faced with this problem. Following the principles of Decision Analysis can allow us to make forecasts of decision outcomes without precise numbers, as long as probability distributions describing the possible values for all variables can be estimated. 

The `decisionSupport` package implements this as a Monte Carlo simulation, which generates a large number of plausible system outcomes, based on random numbers for each input variable that are drawn from user-specified probability distributions. This approach is useful for determining whether a clearly preferable course of action can be delineated based on the present state of knowledge without the need for further information. If the distribution of predicted system outcomes does not imply a clearly preferable decision option, variables identified as carrying decision-relevant uncertainty can then be targeted by decision-supporting research.

The `mcSimulation` function from the `decisionSupport` package can be applied to conduct decision analysis [@R-decisionSupport]. The function requires three inputs:

1. an `estimate` of the joint probability distribution of the input variables. These specify the names and probability distributions for all variables used in the decision model. These distributions aim to represent the full range of possible values for each component of the model. 
1. a `model_function` that predicts decision outcomes based on the variables named in a separate data table. This R function is customized by the user to address a particular decision problem to provide the decision analysis model.  
1. `numberOfModelRuns`	indicating the number of times to run the model function.

These inputs are provided as arguments to the `mcSimulation` function, which conducts a Monte Carlo analysis with repeated model runs based on probability distributions for all uncertain variables. The data table and model are customized to fit the particulars of a specific decision.

### The `estimate`

To support the model building process we design an input table to store the `estimate` values. The table is stored locally as `limpopo_input_table.csv` and contains many of the basic values for the analysis. This table contains all the input variables used in the model. Their distributions are described by 90% confidence intervals, which are specified by lower (5% quantile) and upper (95% quantile) bounds, as well as the shape of the distribution. This model uses four different distributions:

1.	`const` – a constant value
1.	`norm` – a normal distribution
1.	`tnorm_0_1` – a truncated normal distribution that can only have values between 0 and 1 (useful for probabilities; note that 0 and 1, as well as numbers outside this interval are not permitted as inputs)
1.	`posnorm` – a normal distribution truncated at 0 (only positive values allowed)

For a full list of input variables with descriptions and the chosen distributions see the table at the end of this document. 

### The `model_function`

![Model of the social effects of altered river flows on the sustainability of livelihoods in the Limpopo Basin ](figures/Collective_Model.png)

The decision model is coded as an R function which takes in the variables provided in the data table and generates a model output, such as the Net Present Value. 

In the following we use of various decisionSupport functions, which use the `tidyverse` libraries [@tidyverse2019] including `ggplot2` [@R-ggplot2], `plyr` [@R-plyr] and `dplyr` [@R-dplyr] among others in the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) [@R-base]. 

Here we generate a model as a function using `decisionSupport` library we use the `decisionSupport` functions `vv()` to produce time series with variation from a pre-defined mean and coefficient of variation, `chance_event()` to simulate whether events occur and `discount()` to discount values along a time series and generate a Net Present Value for our intervention comparison.

### Scenarios

The following function defines 3 scenarios:

1. No eflows: This is a scenario without eflows. Farmers extract water according to their irrigation needs. Extractions are only limited by the minimum water level that allows operating the pumps.
1. Restricted extraction: This is an eflow scenario, in which eflows are interpreted in a purely ecological sense. Whenever eflows aren't achieved, water extraction is curtailed. There are no measures to add water to the river in such events. We simulate Scenario 1 with our own functions and some from the `nasapower` [@R-nasapower] and `Evapotranspiration` [@R-Evapotranspiration] packages.
1. Dam releases: This is an eflow scenario, in which eflows are interpreted as encompassing the ecological as well as the smallholder irrigation requirement. In case eflows aren't naturally met, water is released from upstream dams to ensure eflows. Extraction by smallholder farmers is restricted only by the ability to operate the pumps.

#### Perform a Monte Carlo simulation with scenarios 

Using the model function above, we can perform a Monte Carlo simulation with the `mcSimulation()` function from `decisionSupport`. This function generates distributions of all variables in the input table as well as the specified model outputs (see `return()` function above) by calculating random draws in our defined `limpopo_decision_function()`. We run a  visual assessment to ensure that all the variables in the input table are included in the model (erroneous variables listed there can cause issues with some of the post-hoc analyses). 

The `numberOfModelRuns` argument is an integer indicating the number of model runs for the Monte Carlo simulation. Unless the model function is very complex, 10,000 runs is a reasonable choice (for complex models, 10,000 model runs can take a while, so especially when the model is still under development, it often makes sense to use a lower number).

We first make a scenario file, for which we can use data for 1980 to 2020.

```{r scenarios}
# load data from Evapotranspiration
data("constants")

# use nasapower for evapotranspiration data
ag_d <- get_power(
  community = "ag",
  lonlat = c(31.08,-23.7),
  pars = c("T2M_MAX", "T2M_MIN", "PRECTOTCORR"),
  dates = c("1981-01-01", "2020-12-31"),
  temporal_api = "daily"
)

# choose years of assessment
years<-1981:2009

# name variables
colnames(ag_d)[c(3:5, 8, 9, 10)] <-
  c("Year", "Month", "Day", "Tmax", "Tmin", "Precipitation")

Inputs <- ReadInputs(c("Tmin", "Tmax"), ag_d, stopmissing = c(50, 50, 50))

  rain[which(rain[, 1] == yyyy), 3]


scenario_variables <-
  c(paste0("river_flow_", 1:12),
    paste0("ET0_", 1:12),
    paste0("prec_", 1:12),
    paste0("eflow_", 1:12))

# write the scenarios file
write.csv(Scenarios, "data/scenarios_1980_2020.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Here we run the model with the `scenario_mc` function from the `decisionSupport` package [@R-decisionSupport]. The function essentially generates a Monte Carlo model with data from existing scenarios for some of the model inputs.

```{r mcSimulation_scenarios}
# run the model with the scenario_mc function 
mcSimulation_results <-
  scenario_mc(
    base_estimate = decisionSupport::estimate_read_csv("data/limpopo_input_table.csv"),
    scenarios = read.csv("data/scenarios_1980_2020.csv", fileEncoding =
                           "UTF-8-BOM"),
    model_function = limpopo_decision_function,
    numberOfModelRuns = 1e2, #run 100 times (2900 with 100 simulations of 29 scenarios)
    functionSyntax = "plainNames"
  )

#save this someplace to share
write.csv(mcSimulation_results, file = "data/mcSimulation_results.csv")
```

We use the `plsr.mcSimulation` function of the `decisionSupport` package to run Partial Least Squares regression on the model outputs. Projection to Latent Structures (PLS), also sometimes known as Partial Least Squares regression is a multivariate statistical technique that can deal with multiple colinear dependent and independent variables [@wold_pls-regression_2001]. It can be used as another means to assess the outcomes of a Monte Carlo model. We use the Variable Importance in the Projection (VIP) scores to identify important variables. VIP scores estimate the importance of each variable in the projection used in a PLS model. VIP is a parameter used for calculating the cumulative measure of the influence of individual variables on the model. Read more in ['A Simple Explanation of Partial Least Squares' by Kee Siong Ng](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~kee/pls.pdf). More information on all these procedures is contained in the [decisionSupport manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/decisionSupport/decisionSupport.pdf), especially under `welfareDecisionAnalysis`.

### "No eflows" scenario

In the "No eflows" scenario, farmers currently face considerable periods of water shortages. On average across all months of the year, between 0 and 80% of crop water needs could not be met by irrigation water extracted from the river.

## Sensitivity analysis

Here we apply the aforementioned post-hoc analysis to the `mcSimulation()` outputs with `plsr.mcSimulation()` to determine the VIP score and coefficients of our PLS regression models. This functions use the outputs of the `mcSimulation()` selecting all the input variables from the decision analysis function in the parameter `object` and then runs a PLS regression with an outcome variable defined in the parameter `resultName`. We also need to import the input table again to replace the labels for the variables on the y-axis. The input table can include a `label` and `variable` column. The standard labels (from the `variable` column) are usually computer readable and not very nice for a plot. The `plot_pls()` function uses the text in the `label` column as replacement for the default text in the `variable` column.
